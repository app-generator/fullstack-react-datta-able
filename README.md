## Product Features

The product aims to help developers skip over the basics and start faster a new full-stack product already enhanced with authentication, a pixel-perfect UI powered by production-ready backends. The fact that makes this full-stack product unique is the JSON-API compliance over multiple servers: 

- [Node JS API](https://docs.appseed.us/boilerplate-code/api-server/node-js): Typescript, Flexible persistence (SQLite, Mongo), TypeORM, Validation
- [Django API Server](https://docs.appseed.us/boilerplate-code/api-server/django): JWT Authentication over DRF, SQLite, Docker 
- [Flask API Server](https://docs.appseed.us/boilerplate-code/api-server/flask): powered by Flask-JWT-extended, SQL-Alchemy, Docker
- Coming soon APIs: FASTapi, Laravel API 

By default, the UI redirects the guest users to the login page. Once the user is authenticated, all private pages are unlocked.
